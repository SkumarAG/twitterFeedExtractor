Once all installation is done, you need to execute the SQL codes to build tweeter feed database. Code is inside the database 
folder under db.sql name.

Now API keys also needed to access twitter API. Get those here - https://apps.twitter.com/app/new

Once you have those keys, go to the configuration file under the name configurationFile.py and change the db and twitter API 
configurations

Now every this is set.

Got to main.py file and supply the desired twitter account id and run you program.
